#1.Consider E = {1, {2, 3}, {2, 4}}, which has three elements: the number 1, the set {2,3} and the set {2,4}. Thus 1 ∈ E and {2,3} ∈ E and {2,4}∈E. But note that 2∉E, 3∉E and 4∉E.

#2.{∅} is a box with an empty box inside it. {∅}≠ ∅。 (You might also note |∅| = 0 and |{∅}| = 1

#3.E = {2n : n ∈ Z} reads as “E equals the set of all things of form 2n, such that n is an element of Z.”

#4.suppose A = {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5, 6}, {7}} and B = {X ∈ A : |X| < 3}. The elements of A are sets (not numbers), so the |X| in the expression for B must mean cardinality. Therefore B = {{1, 2}, {7}}.
